The default Leaflet-CDN markers\n  don't, so they aren't supported.\n* Your browser must support [CORS](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cors) and [Canvas](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas),\n  so `IE >= 10` with no exceptions.\n* This library **does not rasterize HTML** because **browsers cannot rasterize HTML**. Therefore,\n  L.divIcon and other HTML-based features of a map, like zoom controls or legends, are not\n  included in the output, because they are HTML.\n\n__For Leaflet < 1.0.0__: You must set `L_PREFER_CANVAS = true;` so that vector\n  layers are drawn in Canvas\n  \n__For Leaflet >= 1.0.0__: You must set `renderer: L.canvas()` for any layer that\n  you want included in the generated image. You can also set this by setting [`preferCanvas: true`](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.0.html#map-prefercanvas) in your map's options.\n  \n## Plugins that will _not_ work with leaflet-image\n\n* Leaflet.label: will not work because it uses HTML to display labels.\n* Leaflet.markercluster: will not work because it uses HTML for clusters.\n\n### Usage\n\nbrowserify\n\n    npm install --save leaflet-image\n\nweb\n\n    curl https://raw.github.com/mapbox/leaflet-image/gh-pages/leaflet-image.js > leaflet-image.js\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nvar map = L.mapbox.map('map', 'YOUR.MAPID').setView([38.9, -77.03], 14);\nleafletImage(map, function(err, canvas) {\n    // now you have canvas\n    // example thing to do with that canvas:\n    var img = document.createElement('img');\n    var dimensions = map.getSize();\n    img.width = dimensions.x;\n    img.height = dimensions.y;\n    img.src = canvas.toDataURL();\n    document.getElementById('images').innerHTML = '';\n    document.getElementById('images').appendChild(img);\n});\n```\n\n### Plugin CDN\n\nleaflet-image is [available through the Mapbox Plugin CDN](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/plugins/#leaflet-image) so you don't need to download & copy it. Just include the following script tag:\n\n```html\n<script src='//api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/plugins/leaflet-image/v0.0.4/leaflet-image.js'></script>\n```\n\n### API\n\n```js\nleafletImage(map, callback)\n```\n\nmap is a `L.map` or `L.mapbox.map`, callback takes `(err, canvas)`.\n\n## Attribution\n\nAny images you generate from maps that require attribution - which is most, including all from commercial sources and those that include any data from OpenStreetMap - will require the same attribution as the map did. Remember to attribute.\n\n## See Also\n\n* The [Mapbox Static Image API](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/static/) is simpler to use\n  and faster than this approach.\n",
